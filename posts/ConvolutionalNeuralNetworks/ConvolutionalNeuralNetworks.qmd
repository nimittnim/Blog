Convolutional Neural Networks

Use convolution to extract the spacial and temporal features and feed them to a Neural Network.

```{python}
import scipy as sp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

```{python}
# Convolution

def convolve(kernel, X):
    return sp.signal.convolve2d(kernel,X)
```

```{python}
X = plt.imread("Datasets/duck.png")
X = np.mean(X,-1)
plt.imshow(X)
```

```{python}
# Convolving filter

kernel = np.empty((3,3))

kernel[0][0] = -1
kernel[0][1] = -2
kernel[0][2] = -1
kernel[1][0] = 0
kernel[1][1] = 0
kernel[1][2] = 0
kernel[2][0] = 1
kernel[2][1] = 2
kernel[2][2] = 1
```

```{python}
filtered_image = convolve(kernel,X)
```

```{python}
plt.imshow(filtered_image)
plt.set_cmap('Accent')
```
